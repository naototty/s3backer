If you are using buckets with [location constraints](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/index.html?LocationSelection.html) (e.g., EU or US-West) then you must use the `--vhost` flag with **s3backer**.

You can read more details about this requirement [here](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/index.html?LocationSelection.html).
